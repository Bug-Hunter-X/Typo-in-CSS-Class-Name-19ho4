# CSS Typo Bug
This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug: a simple typo in a class name. The CSS defines a class ".myclass", but the HTML references it as ".myclas". This results in the element not being styled as intended.

## Bug
The bug lies in `bug.css` where the intended class name is misspelled in the HTML file. This leads to the element not receiving the intended styles.

## Solution
The solution is to correct the typo in the HTML or CSS file such that the class names match.
